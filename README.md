## My process

Honestly, I don't have much of a process to this sort of thing but just sort of jump around based on what I understand the most and finish it gradually. This time, I set up the html fairly quickly before
moving onto the css to do the toggle switch and cards. After which, I switched gears to get the javascript working.

That involved a bit of trial and error since I ended up changing it from a whole chain of if else statements to a single if else if with each if statement containing
a for each loop in order to reduce the amount of code I had to write  to achieve the same result.

Then it was back to doing css to fix up some design shifts between the two viewport sizes.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Custom JavaScript

### What I learned

Before doing this project, I had no idea how to do a toggle switch (which, safe to say, is a thing a lot of websites use so is probably worth knowing) so learning how to design that was my main thing here
even if I did have to learn it by googling "how to make a toggle switch". As an aside, I spent so long thinking that there was a "toggle switch" input tag so having to learn how to do one manually was kind of interesting, tbh.
